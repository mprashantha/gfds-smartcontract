People who are interested in sending a package to a specific destination browse through the profiles of travelers and choose one of them.         They place the details of their package (dimensions and fragility) and bid a price for the traveler.         If the traveler accepts the bid, the contact details and package handover details (exact time and location) are shared between the two parties.         A part of the payment is transferred to the traveler during the package handover and the remaining part is transferred post acknowledgement of parcel delivery by sender.",
